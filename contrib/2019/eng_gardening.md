# Notes on Gardening

John Chang


## Concepts

[Horticulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture) ("gardening" of fruits and vegetables, typically on a smaller scale) ⟷ [Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture) ("farming" of "field crops" e.g. grains, cotton, tobacco plus "livestock" i.e. animals, typically on a larger scale)

### Organic/Ecological Philosophy

* [Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_ecological_knowledge) (e.g. [F.H. King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Hiram_King), 1911, book: _Farmers of Forty Centuries: Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea, and Japan_)
* [Organic farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming) and [Biodynamic agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture) (Rudolf Steiner, 1924, Austria) - _in response to artificial fertilizers and pesticides_
* [Agroecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agroecology) (K.H.W. Klages, 1928) = ecology of food systems
* [Natural farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_farming) a.k.a. "do-nothing farming" (Masanobu Fukuoka, 1975, Japan, book: _The One-Straw Revolution_)
* [Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) (David Holmgren and Bill Mollison, 1978, Australia) = sustainable ecosystem design (note: incorporates intensive production as "zone 1")

["Sustainable"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture) vs. ["Organic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming) - _organic is not necessarily sustainable and vice versa; truly "sustainable" requires closed-loop (circular) systems_

### Land Use

* Earth's surface area: 510 million km²
	* Earth's land area: 149 million km² (~30%)
		* Earth's [arable land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land): 14 million km² (~10%) - note: shrinking
* Human population: 7.7 billion persons (2019) - note: growing
* So 14 million km² ÷ 7.7 billion persons = ~2000 m² = ~0.5 acre per person ("Our fair share")


## Systems and Methodologies

**Intensive** (high yield from small space) ⟷ **Extensive** (low input over large space)

### Intensive (Small-Scale) Methodologies

* [French intensive gardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_intensive_gardening) (1890s, France)
* [Biodynamic-French Intensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Chadwick) (Alan Chadwick, 1930s, California)
* [GROW BIOINTENSIVE® Sustainable Mini-Farming](http://growbiointensive.org/) (John Jeavons and Ecology Action, 1972, California, book: _How to Grow More Vegetables_) - all measurements in terms of "100 sq ft", e.g. 4×25' beds
* [Square foot gardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_foot_gardening) (Mel Bartholomew, 1981, USA, book: _Square Foot Gardening_) - standard 4×4' beds
* [SPIN-Farming](http://www.spinfarming.com/) and [SPIN-Gardening](http://www.spingardening.com/) (Wally Satzewich, Roxanne Christensen, 2005, Canada and USA) - "_S_-mall _P_-lot _IN_-tensive", standard 2×25' beds

Exemplary [market gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_garden):

* [Urban Homestead](http://urbanhomestead.org/) ([Jules Dervaes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Dervaes), 1985, California, 1/10 acre = ~400 m²)
* [Wally's Urban Market
Garden](http://www.marketgardening.com/) (Wally Satzewich and Gail Vandersteen, 1990, Canada, "sub-acre" (<4000 m²) ) - developer of SPIN-Farming
* [Les Jardins de la Grelinette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Martin_Fortier) (Jean-Martin Fortier and Maude-Hélène Desroches, 2004, Canada, 1.5 acres (~6000 m²), book: _The Market Gardener_) - "biologically intensive" approach


### Extensive (Large-Scale) Methodologies

Exemplary farms:

* [Polyface Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyface_Farm) (Joel Salatin, 500 acre = 2 km²) - featured by Michael Pollan


## Site Design and Crop Selection

* [Hardiness zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone)
* last frost (spring) – first frost (fall)
* [Sunshine duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_duration) 
* [Companion planting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_planting)

Techniques:

* [Double digging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_digging)
* [No-dig gardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-dig_gardening) and [No-till farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-till_farming)
	* [Sheet mulching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_mulching)
	* [Raised-bed gardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised-bed_gardening)
		* [Hügelkultur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCgelkultur) (1900s, Austria etc.)
		* [Keyhole garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_garden) (1990s, Zimbabwe)


## Soil

_You feed the soil, which feeds the roots, which feeds the leaves._

Soil = (minerals + organic matter) + (water + air) + microorganisms


[Soil texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_texture): **sand** (coarse particles) ⟷ **silt** ⟷ **clay** (fine particles)


### Composting

* Aerobic decomposition i.e. composting - emits heat
* Anaerobic decomposition i.e. digestion, fermentation (e.g. [Bokashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokashi_(horticulture))) - emits greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane) and odors (due to organic matters containing sulfur)
* Vermicomposting - uses worms

Composting = "greens" (nitrogen inputs e.g. food waste) + "browns" (carbon inputs e.g. dried leaves) + oxygen (for aerobic bacteria) + time

"Hot" composting (intensive) vs "cold" (passive, no-turn) composting

* ["The Rapid Composting Method"](https://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf) (Robert D. Raabe, 2001)

### Soil Health

* [Crop rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_rotation)
* [Cover crop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_crop) - don't leave the soil bare!
	* [Green manure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_manure)


## Plants

### Lifecycle and Nutrition

[Primary macronutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_nutrition#Macronutrients_(primary)): N-P-K (note: human urine has ~11-1-2.5 NPK ratio)
